\title{Frequency Containment Reserve for Normal operation, activated down-regulation}
\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{start_time_utc}{Start time in UTC. Character array YYYY-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.sssZ}

\item{end_time_utc}{End time in UTC. Character array YYYY-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.sssZ}

\item{user_key}{Character array holding API-key.

\value{
A data frame object with time series data having period 15 min and unit type MW.

\description{
FCR-N is the frequency containment reserve used in the Nordic synchronous system that aims to keep the frequency in normal frequency range between 49,9 - 50,1 Hz. Activated FCR-N volume down (MW) is calculated on the basis of the frequency in the Nordic synchronous system and maintained Finnish FCR-N capacity. Value is the average activated down-regulation power. Negative value means that the frequency has been above 50,0 Hz, and reserve has been activated as down-regulation.
